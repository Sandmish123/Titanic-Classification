# Titanic-Classification
# Problem Statement : 
Make a system which tells whether the person will be save from sinking. What factors were most likely lead to success-socio-economic status, age, gender and more.
# Solution : 
1). I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, analyzing each column's relationship with the 'Survived' column. 
2). I converted categorical data into numeric using label encoding and filtered columns (Age, Fare, Pclass, Sex) based on my observations.
3). I then applied six different machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes,SVM and Random Forest.
4). After thorough evaluation, I achieved the highest accuracy of 81% through decision tree at 5th depth. 
5). This comprehensive approach allowed me to efficiently preprocess the data, select relevant features, and compare the performance of various classifiers, ultimately leading to a successful Titanic classification model.
