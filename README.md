# Titanic-Classification
Problem Statement : Make a system which tells whether the person will be save from sinking. What factors were most likely lead to success-socio-economic status, age, gender and more.
Solution : I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, analyzing each column's relationship with the 'Survived' column. I converted categorical data into numeric using label encoding and filtered columns (Age, Fare, Pclass, Sex) based on my observations. I then applied five different machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Random Forest. After thorough evaluation, I achieved the highest accuracy of 81%. This comprehensive approach allowed me to efficiently preprocess the data, select relevant features, and compare the performance of various classifiers, ultimately leading to a successful Titanic classification model.
